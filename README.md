## Project Motivation

The INSIGHT Data Science Fellows Program is a competitive fellowship targeted at academics from the top universities. It helps recent PhDs and Postdocs to find a prestigious job as data scientists in the industry. I applied for the fellowship twice, made it to interviews, but unfortunately was rejected. So I was really curious about who these top quants are. 


## File Descriptions

You can find the source [code](https://github.com/k-bosko/insight_fellows/blob/master/INSIGHT_Data_Science_Fellowship.ipynb) or read the blog post on my website: [https://www.cross-validated.com/Insight-Data-Science-Fellows/](https://www.cross-validated.com/Insight-Data-Science-Fellows/)


## Results

In this project, I scraped INSIGHT Data Science Fellows, cleaned the data, performed explorative data analysis (EDA) and a hypothesis test via bootstrapping.
