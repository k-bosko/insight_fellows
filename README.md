## Project Motivation
[The INSIGHT Data Science Fellows Program](https://www.insightdatascience.com) is a competitive fellowship targeted at academics from the top universities. It helps recent PhDs and Postdocs to find a prestigious job as data scientists in the industry.

I was really curious about who these top quants are. So I scraped the data from the INSIGHT website and did some quick EDA.
